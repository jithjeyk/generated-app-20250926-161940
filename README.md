# Cryptext Diary

Cryptext Diary is a secure, minimalist, and beautifully designed online journal for private thoughts and daily reflections. The core principle is absolute privacy through client-side encryption: every entry is encrypted in the browser using a user's master password before being sent to the server. This ensures that only the user can ever decrypt and read their content. The application features a calming, distraction-free user interface to foster a focused writing experience. It includes a secure login, a main dashboard with a list of recent entries, and a dedicated, elegant editor for writing and editing.
